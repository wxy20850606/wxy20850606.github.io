Staying late at night is usually unproductive and unhealthy for me, so i've decided to wake up early in the morning.


# 4:30 - 5:00 AM: Preparing My Appearance

Right after waking up, I spend about half an hour on my grooming routine, which includes:

- Brushing my teeth

- Drinking a glass of water

- Washing my face and hair

- Doing my skincare routine

- Doing my makeup routine

I apply sunscreen, followed by a little bit of powder foundation and blush.

This simple makeup routine doesn’t aim for perfection but helps me feel put-together.

Cleaning myself in the morning refreshes me mentally and emotionally.

When I step out of my apartment, I want to feel clear-headed, clean, and well-groomed.

I used to go to the gym right after waking up, brushing only my teeth beforehand. However, I didn’t feel as confident as I do now when I’m fully groomed.

Appearance affects my confidence level. When I feel clean, fresh, and well-groomed, I carry myself with more ease and self-assurance. 

It’s not about looking perfect but about feeling ready and empowered to face the day’s challenges and opportunities.

On days when I skip my grooming routine, I tend to shrink back, hide behind a hat and mask, avoid eye contact, and feel insecure. This impacts my social interactions and overall confidence.

So, appearance doesn’t define my worth, but it definitely influences how i live my day.

Good grooming is important because it goes far beyond just looking neat.
It directly impacts my self-confidence, social interactions, and success in life.

You never know what good things or challenges the day will bring, so being well-prepared is essential.

You never know what good thing is going to happen today.

You never know what challenge you might face today.

So be well-prepared for everyday.

That’s why I dedicate half an hour each morning to taking care of my appearance — it sets the tone for a productive, confident, and successful day.

# 5:00 - 6:00 AM: Morning Walking After Sunrise


1. Connect with Nature

I love walking in nature; it feels like a form of meditation to me. 
It is hard to find nature since i am living in the city.
so I prefer to walk just after sunrise. 
at 5 am, the streets and parks offer a quiet and peaceful atmosphere —it feels almost like walking in nature.

I walk through community parks and along streets, sometime even on the road when there are no cars.
I appreciate the beauty of blooming flowers.
I feel embraced by the trees.
I listen to the vibrant morning birdsong.
I inhale the aroma of my favorite flowers. 
The gentle morning breeze touches my skin.
All of these deepens my connection to nature and the world around me.

Connecting with nature boosts my happiness and improves my mood and sharpens my focus. 
while walking, i ofen find myself smiling.
It grounds me.
The best part is that nature is free and always there for me.
it is like air, which is good and forever and free.

2. A Cleanse for My Soul

I used to have a ton of negative self-talk, but now I don’t have any.

A morning walk feels like a cleanse for my soul.
With each step, I let go of tension, overthinking, negative selftalk, self doubt and worries about uncertanity.
At the same time, i embrace confidence, motivation and courage.

For example, now I even believe that uncertainty in life is a blessing in disguise.

The stillness of the morning, the gentle breeze, and the quiet beauty of nature bring a sense of peace that runs deeper than just physical relaxation. 

It’s a moment of reconnection—with myself and the world around me.
 
In that space, my mind becomes clearer, my body feels lighter, my soul feels pure and I return home not just refreshed, but spiritually renewed.

A morning walk isn't just physical exercise; it's a moving meditation and a spiritual cleansing.

It nurtures my soul.

3. Energy

The more I enjoy something, the greater the energy I can draw from it. During my morning walk, I appreciate the beauty of trees, flowers, and wildlife. I appreciate the sunrise and the walk itself.

I appreciate myself for having the ability to enjoy the beauty of a wonderful morning. I appreciate my past self who brought me to this moment. I appreciate everyone who comes into my life. I appreciate everything that happens to me, whether good or bad.

Good things bring me joy; bad things teach me to grow. Through all this appreciation, I gain a tremendous amount of energy. This energy lifts me up and makes me feel that nothing is impossible.

After the walk, I feel motivated, full of energy and positivity, and completely recharged.

It even shifts my focus from scarcity to abundance.

4. Thinking and Focus

While I am walking on trails, I do a lot of thinking.

Walking opens up a free flow of ideas and thoughts. It increases my ability to come up with many novel ideas, and the benefits persist throughout the whole day, even after I stop walking.

Sometimes, I choose to reflect on specific topics—personal goals, some projects, or simply positive affirmations. Other times, I give my mind space to wander freely.

I use my Notion app to capture any thoughts or plans inspired by the walk. After gathering many ideas, I try to write a blog post or make a video to organize and share them.

5. Fat Loss

Every morning, I walk over 7,000 steps, and every day, I walk more than 15,000 steps. 
This helps me burn calories and create a calorie deficit, which supports fat loss.

Over the past six months, I have lost 4 kg, most of which was belly fat. Thanks to weight training, I have also gained 1.5 kg of muscle during this time. Walking helps me lose fat while maintaining lean muscle mass.

6. It Helps Me Go to Bed Early

Exposing myself to natural light in the morning helps reset my circadian rhythm. 
Because of this, I feel tired by 9 p.m. and usually go to bed around 9:30 p.m. 
I naturally wake up before 4:30 a.m.

I’m in a positive feedback loop, so this routine feels effortless for me.
 If I were asked to stay up late for even one night, it would feel like torture.

# 6:00 - 6:20 AM: Stretch and Yoga

My body has become quite stiff from a sedentary lifestyle in my 20s and caring for children in my 30s, so I dedicate 20 minutes each day to stretching.

Stretching helps release muscle tension and reduces strain. More than that, it creates a connection between my body, mind, and soul—bringing balance and calm to my entire being.

 # 6:20 - 7:20 AM: weight training

Someone once asked Naval Ravikant, “What habit would you say most positively impacts your life?”
He replied, *“The daily morning workout. That has been a complete game-changer.”*

For me, that daily morning workout is weight training.

We all know the tremendous benefits of weight training: it helps build muscle, increases strength, and improves bone density.

The main reason I started weight training is that I’m approaching 40 and want to preserve muscle for the future.
But to my surprise, weight training has changed so much more than just my body.

## How Weight Training Has Transformed Me
- Healthier Eating Habits: Weight training motivated me to quit sugar and all kinds of snacks. Now, I focus on nutrient-dense, low-GI whole foods.

- Better Sleep: I go to bed earlier because I need quality rest to repair muscle fatigue.

- Mindset Shift: Weight training is a metaphor for life. Each workout pushes me beyond my comfort zone. I’ve learned that, like in life, stepping out of comfort zones and facing challenges helps me grow stronger and more resilient.

- Increased Confidence: My personality has changed—I’m more confident. Every time I lift heavier weights, it feels like a small win. Celebrating these small victories reinforces my belief in myself and motivates me to keep going.

- Body Composition: My body fat has dropped from 28% to 23%, and I now see defined lines on my stomach in the morning. Every time I look in the mirror, I appreciate my body more. The more I appreciate it, the more energy I gain from it.

- New Courage: Weight training has inspired me to pursue things I once feared. For example, I didn’t have the courage to speak with native English speakers before, but now I confidently create content in English.

Because of all these amazing benefits, I make weight training my first priority every morning. I dedicate one hour to it before anything else. My usual routine includes pull-ups, squats, and bench presses.

Whether you’re aiming for a healthier body or a stronger mind, weight training is a powerful, long-term investment in yourself.

# The End
This is my early morning routine. I’ve fallen in love with it.
I’m addicted and can’t skip a day. 
I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

This routine has transformed my body, my personality, my confidence, and my way of thinking. It equips me with so much positivity, motivation, energy, and focus. 
It has also taught me the value of self-discipline and persistence.

I believe that all of these together will have a huge, lasting impact on my life.

If you haven’t yet discovered your own morning ritual, I invite you to begin today. Embrace the quiet power of the early hours, and watch how your life begins to transform.
